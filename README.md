# Supervised-Semi-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Learning
This project explores different **machine learning paradigms**—supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning—using real-world datasets. The goal is to compare the effectiveness of various approaches using **SVMs, K-Means, and Spectral Clustering** while analyzing their performance using **Monte Carlo simulations**.
